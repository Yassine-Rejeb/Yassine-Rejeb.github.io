As a Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Linux cloud infrastructure and a passion for cybersecurity, I am dedicated to continuous learning and professional development. With certifications in RHCSA, RHCE, AWS CCP, and eJPT, I have a solid foundation in Linux administration, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge and skills through additional courses, workshops, and personal projects. I am interested in exploring the latest trends and best practices in DevSecOps, cloud security, and security administration, and I am excited to contribute to the wider community of cybersecurity professionals. Whether through networking, online communities, or participation in industry events, I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. If you share my passion for cybersecurity and Linux cloud infrastructure, I would love to connect and exchange knowledge and ideas.
