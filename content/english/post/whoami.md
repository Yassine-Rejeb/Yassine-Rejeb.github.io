## I am ..
<p>
Mohamed Yassine REJEB, a 23 years old tunisian with interests in cybersecurity, cloud and linux.
</p>

## Studies
I got my license (associate degree) in ICT (specialty Network security) from ISET'COM in tunis.
I am now studying for my engineering degree in network and systems security in TEK-UP university.
While in these universities, I have had internships and gained some profitional experience alongside my extra-curriculum tinkering in fields that peeked my interest.

## Goals and Aspirations
To say the truth, I have no specific role I am persuing but rather interested in technologies and tools (such as linux, ansible, docker, kubernetes, cloud, terraform, ..) that will entitle me to positions like system adminitrator, security adminitrator, Cloud security engineer, DevSecOps Operator, ...

## Hobbies and Past-times
Though I like watching anime and series and playing video games, I am starting to lower their doses in relation to IT tinkering. I am also a CTF Player, trying to master pwn and reverse engineering.
